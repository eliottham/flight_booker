	This is a project on creating a one way flight booker taken from the
Odin Project Curriculum. The focus of this project was to learn advanced
form helper techniques such as nested forms and dropdown menus as well as 
gain familiarity with seeding the database. The project outline can be found at 
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lc-pb.
This project was built for form functionality rather than styling and validating.
